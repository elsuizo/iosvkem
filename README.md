**Iosvkem** is a dark colourscheme based on the colourscheme made by
[Belleve Invis](https://github.com/be5invis) to showcase his typeface 
[Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/). 

A few tweaks were made and a bunch of unnecessarily bright colours have been
added for the ui but the main colours remain very close to the original
colourscheme.

Having been made using [lifepillar](https://github.com/lifepillar)'s
*so good it should ship with vim* 
[Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate) plugin, it
supports both true colours and 256 colours terminal emulators.

- The ui is probably lacking a few things. Hit me up if you find something
wrong.

- I have added a couple tweaks to fix the default syntax files for markdown and
restructuredtext. I don't intend to add support for 3rd party syntax files if
vim ships with a syntax file for the corresponding language unless the default
syntax file is unequivocally garbage.

- I have added an on/off toggle for italicized characters. Turns out you can 
spend 5000 dollars on a machine in 2018 and still have to play the escape code
game to get something as basic as italics working. 

#### Installation instructions

**1998**: `Iosvkem.vim` goes in `~/.vim/colors/`.

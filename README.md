**Iosvkem** is a dark colourscheme based on the colourscheme made by
[Belleve Invis](https://github.com/be5invis) to showcase his typeface 
[Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/). 

A few tweaks were made and a bunch of unnecessarily bright colours have been
added for the ui but the main colours remain very close to the original
colourscheme.

Having been made using [lifepillar](https://github.com/lifepillar)'s
*so good it should ship with vim* 
[Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate) plugin, it
supports both true colours and 256 colours terminal emulators.

- Iosvkem's ui is probably completely busted. I'll eventually bump into issues
and fix them, but help is most welcome.

- I will eventually refactor the dayglo colours out, most likely as an option.

- I did add markdown support for the default vim syntax file as highlighting
is quite broken otherwise but it is unlikely I'll ever add anything 
language-specific to Iosvkem. I consider this is the kind of things that should
be done by the syntax file or the end user, not by colourschemes.
I have pretty bad PTSD from looking at the code of some of the most popular
ones that feature lots of really convoluted optional settings for some 
languages or frameworks.  
With that being said,If you feel something is missing and this particular 
something doesn't risk interacting too much with syntax files or plugins I'll 
give it a fair shake. 

Don't be afraid of opening an issue or submitting a pull request. I don't bite
and even when I do, they don't live long enough to tell.
The only thing I ask is that the changes be made to the template and a new .vim
colour scheme generated. Managing changes backwards would be a nightmare.

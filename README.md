**Iosvkem** is a dark colourscheme based on the colourscheme designed by
[Belleve Invis](https://github.com/be5invis) to showcase their typeface 
[Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/). 

It supports both true colours and 256 colours terminal emulators. There is 
some limited support for monochrome terminals, which I can only hope will be 
useful to our children as they hide from the radioactive fallout in underground
bunkers.

I have no interest in supporting 3rd party plugins, or alternative syntax files
unless the default files that ship with vim are broken or inferior to the point
of being useless.

I have had to rewire a few things for markdown, rst and diffs to work properly,
but the rest of the theme respects the conventions built-in within vim. 
Switching from Iosvkem to another theme shouldn't break anything else.


Iosvkem was made using [colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate).
It's good. Try it.

#### Installation instructions

**1998**: `Iosvkem.vim` goes in `~/.vim/colors/`.  
**2019**: for the love of god use a plugin manager.
